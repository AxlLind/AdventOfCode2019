# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to all [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) problems. I did them all in Rust to get more familiar with the language. This was the first year I participated and it a lot of fun. The parts with the [IntCoder](./src/intcoder.rs), emulating a CPU, were so cool. I learned a ton and got a lot better at Rust!

Huge thanks to everyone who makes AoC possible, you're amazing.

## Leaderboard
I did not attempt to get high leaderboard scores since, in my timezone, I would have to get up really early. I still managed to get around top 1-2k on a lot of the later ones and even `774th` on [one star](./src/bin/22.rs). Finished most of them the day they came out.
