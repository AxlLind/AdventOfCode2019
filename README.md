# AdventOfCode2019

My solutions to all [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) 2019 problems. I did them all in Rust to get more familiar with the language. This was the first year I participated and it a lot of fun. The parts with the IntCoder, emulating a CPU, were amazing. I learnt a lot and got a lot better at Rust!

## Leaderboard
I did not attempt to get high leaderboard scores since, in my timezone, I would have to get up really early. Still managed to get around top 1-2k on a lot of the later ones and even 774th on one star. Did most of them each day they came out.
